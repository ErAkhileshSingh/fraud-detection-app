# Fraud Detection App

This repository contains a project for detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The majority of the code is written in Jupyter Notebooks, with supporting Python scripts.

## Features

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- Interactive Streamlit web app

## Live Demo

You can try the app live [here](https://fraud-detection-app-kmazc6jfpdv5apactetnyu.streamlit.app/) — the link to the deployed Streamlit app is also provided in the description.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x or latest
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
